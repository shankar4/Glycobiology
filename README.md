# Glycobiology
Molecular study of carbohydrates involved in the assembly of complex multicellular organs and organisms. This requires interactions between cells and the surrounding matrix. Cells and many macromolecules have attached sugars (mono or oligo-saccharides), referred to as glycans [Varki et al.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK316258/).  Hyaluronan, a major glycan, seems to have a central role in ECM synthesis and degeneration. 

Scientists so far have assumed that studying DNA, RNA, and proteins is sufficient to understand the etiology of human diseases. Recent GWAS studies seem to have stalled in their ability to relate heritability to the human genome. This is an attempt to explore another major class of macromolecules (the other one being lipids) and develop systems level concepts to explain disease progression/retardation (our focus is CVD) with lifestyle (stress management, food habits, etc), environmental (pollution, sociability, etc), and other/modifiable factors (aging, exercise, diet, and medication)

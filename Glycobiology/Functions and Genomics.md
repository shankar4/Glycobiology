Biological functions: (1) structural and modulatory, including nutrient storage and sequestration; (2) specific recognition  - by GBP or glycan binding proteins (typically); and (3) molecular mimicry of host glycans. Intrinsic GBPs mediate cell to cell interactions or recognize EC molecules, and recognize glycans on the same cell. Extrinsic GBPs comprise of pathogens. *A given glycan can have different roles in different tissues, at different times in development (organism-intrinsic functions) or in different environmental contexts (organism-extrinsic functions)*. Specific biological functions are mediated via terminal sequences, unusual structures, and modifications of glycans. Genetic defects in glycosolation are easily obtained in cultured cells, but have limited biological impact in Vitro. Same defects in whole organisms may be catastrophic. Thus major glycan functions are operative mainly within an intact multicellular organism.

Glycans have protective, stabilizing,  organizational, and barrier functions. Glycan constituents of matrix molecules, such as proteoglycans, function to control tissue structure, porosity, and integrity. Such molecules also contain binding sites for other specific glycans, which aids overall matrix organization. They also act as a protective storage depot for  biologically key molecules. E.g., heparin-binding growth factors bind GAG chanins of ECM, adjacent to cells that need to be stimulated. This prevents their diffusion, protects from nonspecific proteolysis, and prolongs their active lives, while allowing them to be released under specific conditions. Also, polymerized glycans such as starch and cellulose (in plants) and glycogen (in animals) serve to store & sequester nutrients.

Junk glycans can accumulate similar to junk DNA; but junk DNA consists of selfish DNA elements capable of replicating, whereas glycans cannot encode additional copies of themselves. 

Genomic View: A number of glycosyltransferases (GTs), glycoside hydrolases (GHs, also called glycosidases), nuclear sugar transporters, and other enzymes are required to synthesize and metaboloze glycans. Also, many genes encode glycan binding proteins (GBPs), which bind with specific glycan structures. **The human and mouse glycomes have many glycan structures in common, but a few are unique or have different functional properties**. CAZY database includes 25000 genomes as of 2015 and 158 GTs with a known 3-D structure. Gts from different organisms diplay the same basic structural folds, and we can harness the relationships between the sequence and the specificity of a GT. Number of GT genes is variable, but much less within a taxonomic clade. # of GTs is > the # of GHs (in higher animals). Mammalian genome encodes 100 to 200 GBPs. 

Earlier, GT and GH were given EC (Enzyme Commission) numbers with x (specificity), y(sugar transferred), and z (donor/acceptor name). Could not accomodate enzymes that act on several substrates. A new system: classifies GTs and GHs on the basis of relationship between AA sequence and folding similarities. Sequences that display similarity are grouped in the same family, regardless of activity and substrate specificity. As of August 2016, there are 260K GT sequences in 100 families in CAZy. Each family is annotated with known enzyme activities and includes catalytic and structural features. This is followed by a list of proteins and ORFs for each familty. Families are 'polyspecific', which indicates that (1) new specificity acquisition by GH or GT is a common evolutionary event, (2) their substrate specificities can be engineered for experimental or applied purposes, and (3) their substrate (or product) specificities are governed by fine details of 3-D structure, not by global fold. Human GTs are listed at [KEGG](https://www.genome.jp/kegg/glycan/) and [Functional Glycomics Gateway](http://www.functionalglycomics.org/).

Biological functions: (1) structural and modulatory, including nutrient storage and sequestration; (2) specific recognition  - by GBP or glycan binding proteins (typically); and (3) molecular mimicry of host glycans. Intrinsic GBPs mediate cell to cell interactions or recognize EC molecules, and recognize glycans on the same cell. Extrinsic GBPs comprise of pathogens. *A given glycan can have different roles in different tissues, at different times in development (organism-intrinsic functions) or in different environmental contexts (organism-extrinsic functions)*.

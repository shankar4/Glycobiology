This is based on Chapters 48 to 60 of the online book. Summary planned for later. 

A few comments from Chapter 60 on Future directions in Glycosciences:

Given all the major advances in basic and applied research on glycans, these biomoleculres no longer are the "dark matter of the biological universe." But an entire generation of scientists have had no exposure to glycans. This will slow down their incorporation in scientific endeavors. "Continued advances in basic and applied research on glycans will occur, but this needs to be coupled with the training of a new generation of scientists, engineers, and physicians, for whom these molecules will be an obvious aspect of their understanding of living systems, in health and disease."

Most major diseases involve disordered inflammation and immunity, in which the glycan-binding selectins, Siglecs, galectins, and other GBPs play critical roles. Most pathogens etc enter the cells by binding to glycans on the cell surface. Many vaccines against infectious agents are directed against microbial glycans. "Proteoglycans play critical roles in development, tissue morphogenesis, and cardiovascular disease and in regulating the actions of cytokines and growth factors. The glycosaminoglycan heparin is one of the oldest and most commonly used “drugs” in the clinic." Many current therapeutics, such as monoclonal antibodies, require N-glycans for efficacy. ... Study of glycan will be essential for understanding the pathophysiology of most diseases and the development of effective therapies. Educating the new scientific community is a first good step.

" In the future, glycoscience will play a critical role in the evolution of our society from one based on burning fossil fuels to one based on the use of sustainable energy, in part derived from rapidly growing plants and algae. .....As our supply of petroleum runs out, glycans will increasingly be used to provide materials for the manufacture of plastics and a myriad of polymers."

Some major fundamental questions for the future: Only ones relevant to my research are listed here.

(1) Can Specific Glycoforms of Glycoproteins Be Used to Improve Biomarkers for Disease? They might improve specificity and sensitivity of cancer diagnosis.

(2) How Can the Marked Mobility of Glycans in Biological Systems Be Taken into Account? Unlike most other biomolecules, glycans are mobile in aqueous solution. This increases the potential information content of these molecules....

(3) How Can One Decode the Information Content in Glycosaminoglycans and Proteoglycans at the Molecular Level? Their arrangement affects affinity and protein-binding selectivity. Understanding how such diversity is regulated temporally and spatially is also a major challenge. 

(4) Do More Complex Biological Systems Have Simpler Glycosylation? Less than a dozen are found in vertebrates, and many more are found in simpler, earlier evolved systems. "Is this an ascertainment bias, or does increasing biological complexity place limits on the fraction of the genome that can be committed to controlling glycosylation?"

(5) When Will the Integration of Glyosciences into the Mainstream of Bioinformatics Be Achieved? "...searches of the main genome and protein databases used by essentially all biologists yield almost no information on the glycosylation state of glycoproteins." An international effort is underway.

(6) When Will Glycobiology Completely Merge into a Holistic Approach to Biology? "...biochemists and biologists will come to recognize that glycan modifications are no less important than the amino acids that make up the polypeptide backbone or the nucleotides and nucleotide derivatives that make up DNA and RNA."

N-Glycans: Biosynthesis of N-glycans is most complex in mammals. They are covalently attached to protein at Asn residues by an N-glycosidic bond. Mouse mutants have helped gain insight on the functional aspects. Deletion of *Mgat1* gene that encodes MGAT1 leads to embryonic death. They are important in **retaining** growth factor and cytokine receptors at the cell suface. N-Glycans are knon to become more branched in cancer cells which accelerates the cancer progression. Tumors formed in mice with MGAT5 deleted are retarded in their progression. Thus, certain GTs may be appropriate targets for cancer therapy. 

Structures common to different glycans (N and O-glycans, and glycolipids): mature glycans extend these cores and may include human blood group determinants. The ABO blood group antigens are presented on type-1 or type-2 LacNAc, on O-GalNAc glycans (type-3), or on glycolipds (type-4). These are formed by the sequential action of GTs encoded by the *ABO, H,* and *Se* genes, now termed the *ABO, FUT1,* and *FUT2* loci.

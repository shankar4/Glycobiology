It is a naturally occuring GAG that finds extensive surgical use. As it is viscoelastic, it has lubricating and cushioning attributes that are useful during eye surgery. It has antiadhesvie properties, useful for postsurgical wound healing. It is also used as a tissue filler in cosmetic surgery. GBPs that bind to the nonsulfated GG HA (hyaldherins) share an evolutionarily conserved fold that helps with recognition of short segments of the invariant HA repeating disaccharide.

It is a naturally occuring GAG that finds extensive surgical use. As it is viscoelastic, it has lubricating and cushioning attributes that are useful during eye surgery. It has antiadhesvie properties, useful for postsurgical wound healing. It is also used as a tissue filler in cosmetic surgery. GBPs that bind to the nonsulfated GG HA (hyaldherins) share an evolutionarily conserved fold that helps with recognition of short segments of the invariant HA repeating disaccharide. 

HAs bind to specific mebrane proteins, including CD44. In some cells, this leads to clustering of CD44, which activates kinases. This alters the interaction of  the cytoplasmic tail of CD44 with regulatory and adaptor molecules that impact the cytoskeletal assembly/disassembly and cell survival and proliferation. Low Molecular weight glycans are more active in triggering danger responses via binding to Toll-like receptor's (TLR's) responses. In contrast, signaling via sulfated GAGs is indirect and has no downstream response.

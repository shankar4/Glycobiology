Simple monosaccharides have the general formula C<sub>x</sub>(H2O)<sub>n</sub>, where n is an integer ranging from 3 to 9. The acyclic (aldehyde or Ketone) form of a monosacch is present in small amount (<0.01%). However, they impact the chemical reactions that eventually consume the sugar. Aldoses and ketoses were historically referred to as 'reducing sugars.' They can also undergo Schiff's base formation with amines or hydrazides, forming imines and hydrazones, respectively. This reaction occurs in forming protein glycoconjugate. 

Only sources of energy for living organisms are monosacchs. Glycans are oligosacchs (with <12 monosacchs) or polysacchs (with >12 monosacchs). The latter may have repeating subunits of linked monosacchs. Such assemblies lead to enormous diversity and widely varying properties (cell-surface interactions, proteins involved in differentiation, recognition, and proliferation of cells, and structural support).

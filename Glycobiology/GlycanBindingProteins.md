GBPs (excluding glycan-specific antibodies) are of two types: **lectins and sulfated GAG (glycosaminoglycan)-binding proteins**. Lectins are  identified by CRDs (carbohydrate-recognition domains) that define structural similarities. They recognize terminal groups on glycans and fit into shallow and well-defined binding pockets. In contrast, proteins that bind to sulfated GAGs (heparan, chondroitin, dermantan, and keratan sulfates) bind to carboxylinc acid and sulfate groups all along GAG chains via positively charged AAs. Most of these proteins are not evolutionarily related. GBPs that bind to the nonsulfated GG HA (hyaldherins) share an evolutionarily conserved fold that helps with recognition of short segments of the invariant HA repeating disaccharid.

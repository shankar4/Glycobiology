From The first seven chapters of "Essentials of Gycobiology", 3rd edition, Varki et al., (eds), 2017:

**Historical background and overview**: Glycobiology is the study of the structure, biology, and evoluation of saccharides (aka carbohydrates, sugar chains, or glycans) and proteins that recognize them. Glycans can also be freestanding (e.g., Hyaluronan). Glycans modulate or mediate events in inter/intra-cellular and cell to matrix interactions critial to the development and function of complex organisms. The earlier view: sources of energy and structural, with no other biological activity. Study of glycans also lagged because of structural complexity and variability, and an inability to predict their biosynthesis from a DNA template, as possible for proteins. Glycobiology, the study of glycans, is now rapidly expandiing, thanks to many new technologies of today, and renewed scientific inquiry. 

A monosaccharide is a carbohydrate that cannot be hydrolyzed into a simpler form. Two types of monosacchs, based on where a carbonyl group is attached: Aldoses (at the end of the carbon chain) and ketones (at an inner carbon). Ring forms of monosacchs are typical in Oligosacchs, a linear or branched chain of monosacchs. Polysacch refers to large glycans with repeating oligosacch motifs. Glycans constitute a large portion of glycoconjugates. Cells are covered with a dense array of sugars (<b>glycocalyx</b>). Monosacchs can be linked together in many more ways Vs AAs or nucleotides. E.g., 3 different nucleotides or AAs can only generate 6 trimers (ABC, ACB, BAC, BCA, CAB, and CBA), just three different hexoses (a monosacch) could theoretically produce 1056 to 27648 (24 x 24 x 24 x 2 - 24?) unique trisacchs. 

Symbol Nomenclature for Glycans (SNFG): Details are [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/glycans/snfg.html). Each colored symbol represents a specific monosacch. One software tool is found [here](http://glycam.org/docs/othertoolsservice/2016/06/03/3d-symbol-nomenclature-for-glycans-3d-snfg/). 

A 3D-SNFG example is shown below:

Major classes: Glycans are defined as per linkage to an aglycone (protein or lipid). A glycoprotein is a protein that carries one or more glycans attached to a polypeptide backbone, usually via N- or O- linkages. A mucin is a large glycoprotein with many clustered O-glycans. A proteoglycan is a glycoconjugate with one or more GAG (glycosaminoglycan) chains attached to a core protein. Distinction between two (glycoprotein and proteoglycan) is arbitrary. 

Common glycan classes are shown below:
